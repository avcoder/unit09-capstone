# Proposal Phase

- Choose an idea for your application. It could be a web or mobile app that:
   - solves a problem
   - entertains
   - educates
   - or serves any other purpose you find meaningful.
- Write a brief project proposal (1-2 pages) outlining 
   - your idea,
   - its features,
   - target audience,
   - and technology stack you plan to use.
- Submit this proposal for approval before starting the development.

   - component structure,
   - data flow,
   - and state management.
- Use industry-standard practices for your design, such as
   - modularization, 
   - separation of concerns,
   - and adherence to design patterns.

# Development Phase

- Set up your development environment and initialize your project using appropriate tools and frameworks: 
   - React, React Native,
   - Node.js,
   - Express,
   - MongoDB.
- Develop the application following your design.
- Ensure your code is
   - clean,
